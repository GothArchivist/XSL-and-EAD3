			<head>Biography of Salazar Slytherin</head>
			<p>Salazar Slytherin was born in the first half of the tenth century, somewhere in fen-country England. Researchers believe it was likely Norfolk, Lincolnshire, or Cambridgeshire, but may have been a connected county. He came from a family of pure-blood wizards, although the names of his parents are not recorded. It is unknown whether he trained at a school of the time, at home, or under a master. Together with Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff, he founded the <expan abbr="HSWW">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</expan>.</p>
			<p>At Hogwarts, Slytherin taught Legilimency, the magical art of forming a mental connection with another's mind and extracting information or interacting with their thought processes. This may have been a genetic talent, as his descendent, Tom Riddle, was also a noted legilimens. Slytherin was also a Parselmouth, a known genetic trait, and able to speak with snakes. He bred at least one basilisk, which he left at Hogwarts in the Chamber of Secrets. The Chamber remained unopened until 1943, when Riddle opened it and used the basilisk to attack Muggle-borns. The basilisk was not killed until 1993.</p>
			<p>Slytherin believed that the school should only teach pure-blood students and should definitely not accept students whose parents were both Muggles. His own house, Slytherin, continued this tradition, but the other founders overruled him. After an argument with Godric Gryffindor, which may have involved a duel, Slytherin left the school.</p>
			<p>While it is not known when or where Slytherin died, one of his spell books and a final journal were recovered shortly before the turn of the twelfth century by Slytherin alumnus and professor Albert Shallowheart. It is assumed that Slytherin was dead when these books were recovered.</p>

			<p>During the <subject rules="wizlib"  normal="Wizarding War, 1970-1981">First Wizarding War, 1970-1981</subject>, a group of <corpname rules="wizlib" >Knights of Walpurgis (Death Eaters)</corpname> stole Syltherin realia from its library display. Known items stolen were Salazar Slytherin's signet ring, a painting (circa 1500) of Slytherin's ancestral home, a ceremonial dagger belonging to Slytherin, and an enchanted 11th century numismatic collection. Use copies of spell books in the archival collection were also taken and had to be recreated. The original Slytherin papers were in the vault, which had been protected by a Disillusionment Charm.</p>

				<p>In 1965, as part of her research for <title render="italic">Hogwarts: A History</title>, Bathilda Bagshot created an index of letters between Hogwarts founders based on subject and occasional date information. Each entry contains a brief summary of the letter's context and contents. A copy of this index is available for researchers. It was also used to create <ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://catalog.hogwarts.ac.uk/record=b11713487" xlink:show="new" xlink:actuate="onRequest"><title render="italic">Correspondence of the Hogwarts Founders</title></ref>, see <ptr xlink:type="simple" target="ah876" xlink:title="Alternate Form Available" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for further details.</p>

				<head>Scope and Content</head>
				<p>This series consists of scrolls on which Slytherin recorded notes for the teaching legilimency, charms, and care of magical creatures. Notes include references to many books which no longer exist, lists of class topics, and detailed notes on the subjects. Many researchers find these useful for deriving an impression of Slytherin's teaching philosophy and priorities.</p>

					<p>Many researchers are unaware of Slytherin's time as a teacher of the Care of Magical Creatures class. His notes demonstrate a strong affinity with the darker magical creatures and certain letters between Slytherin and Helga Hufflepuff call into question his methods of binding particular creatures to his will.</p>

					The following are sample passages from Slytherin's journals:<lb/>
					Refining <emph render="italic">Legilimency</emph>. I believe I have discovered the secret of doing more than parsing thought. I may now twist memories to create visions.
					<lb/>
					A quarrel today between my students and those mudbloods allowed in by Hufflepuff. It may become necessary to withhold the teaching of <emph render="italic">Crucio</emph> until the final year of studies. Hufflepuff has suggested that the matter should be brought before the Wizards' Council and wants to expel young Lucian. I will talk to Godric about instituting an internal court for trials concerning student matters. Expulsion should be a matter of last resort, for if we do not train these bright young talents, they may be vulnerable to Muggle courts and burning.

				<p>The journals are sequential, each covering mundane activities of Slytherin's life. Some days simply record classes or meetings, others have notes with his opinions and thoughts on particular topics. The journals contain <emph render="bolditalic">no</emph> magical content (spells, potion recipes, etc.), although all four include his opinions concerning the use and teaching of magic. The journals begin just before the founding of Hogwarts and continue until shortly past his departure. He appears to have used them primarily to express opinions and to record information for future reference. The final journal was found in a small residence near <geogname>Slackbuie, Scotland</geogname> by professor Albert Shallowheart along with his spell book on jinxes. It only contained 5 entries subsequent to his departure from Hogwarts, none of which gave details about his locations after leaving Hogwarts.</p>
				<p>Over the centuries, many Slytherin faithful have combed the Slackbuie area looking for signs of his presence there. However, if any information has been found, it has not been published or passed down through common lore.</p>

				<head>Custodial History</head>
				<p>Based on the pattern of acquisition, Slytherin's spell books have been passed down through the Peverell and Gaunt families. It seems likely that Slytherin visisted one of more of his children and close friends after his departure from Hogwarts and left his spell books in their charge. By the point of his death, it seems unlikely that he would have had need for consulting reference materials as he was a highly-accomplished wizard. Early archivists speculate that he retained his book of jinxes in order to record new spells and was not able to transmit it to its designated party before his death.</p>
